# Supplementary Material for "Surrogate Management Strategies for Accelerating Parallel Algorithm Portfolio Construction"

The experiments are divided into two phases: Phase I compares candidate surrogate models, and Phase II constructs Parallel Algorithm Portfolios to compare surrogate model management strategies.

## Phase I - Comparison of candidate surrogate models

* [/phase1](phase1) - main directory
* [/phase1/processed](phase1/processed) - directory containing dataset generated by executing 1,000 randomly selected LKH configurations on 100 generated TSP instances, yielding 100,000 evaluations
* [/phase1/results](phase1/results) - hyperparameter optimization results, separated by scenario: (1) constant 1-second cut-off time, (2) cut-offs scaled according to problem size
* [/phase1/src](phase1/src) - directory containing model implementations, hyperparameter optimization search spaces, and other additional functions for hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation
* [/phase1/comparison_const_cut_off_1.ipynb](phase1/comparison_const_cut_off_1.ipynb), [/phase1/comparison_0_10.ipynb](phase1/comparison_0_10.ipynb) - notebooks containing all code required for hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation for all three scenarios

## Phase II - Parallel Algorithm Portfolio Construction and Comparison of Surrogate Model Management Strategies

* [/phase2](phase2) - main directory
* [/phase2/data/TSP](phase2/data/TSP) - directory containing TSP instances on which PAPs were constructed and evaluated
* [/phase2/src](phase2/src) - directory containing PAP construction framework implementation
* [/phase2/py_policy.py](phase2/py_policy.py) - the main file for running PAP construction and evaluation with the selected portfolio training set size and surrogate model management strategy
* [/phase2/results.ipynb](phase2/results.ipynb) - a notebook for results aggregation and visualization
